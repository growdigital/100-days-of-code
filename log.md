# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1 Jan 2018

**Today's Progress**: Part fixed [Groundwork](https://github.com/growdigital/groundwork/) `/blog/` functionality. It's a blog template written for Metalsmith. Still have to fix `/status/`, as it is now subsumed into the `/blog/` directory.

**Thoughts:** Am I really programming? Feels like I spend most of my life configuringâ€¦ ! (mostly in [index.js](https://github.com/growdigital/groundwork/blob/master/index.js)

### Day 2 Jan 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished permalinks being `/blog/` and `/status/`. 

**Thoughts:** How much am I learning?
